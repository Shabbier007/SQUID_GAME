Choose one child to be the “BLACKPINK(doll)”. Facing the rest of the group and standing a dozen or so feet from the rest of the kids, the cop closes his/her eyes and says, “red light, green light, one, two, three!” While the cop’s eyes are closed, the other players race toward him/her. But on the count of three, everyone must freeze and the cop opens his/her eyes! If the cop sees anyone moving, that person is sent back to the starting point. The first person to reach the traffic cop wins.
